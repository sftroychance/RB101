The Ruby Array class has several methods for removing items from the array. Two of them have very similar names. Let's see how they differ:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
What do the following method calls do (assume we reset numbers to the original array between method calls)?

numbers.delete_at(1)
numbers.delete(1)

***

numbers.delete_at(1) will delete the element at index 1, resulting in:
  [1, 3, 4, 5]

numbers.delete(1) will delete any element that is the digit 1, resulting in:
  [2, 3, 4, 5]

note these are mutating but do not have ! at the end of the method name
