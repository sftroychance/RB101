What would you expect the code below to print out?

numbers = [1, 2, 2, 3]
numbers.uniq

puts numbers

****

I would expect this to print out:
1
2
2
3

- uniq does not mutate (uniq! does), and the value of numbers.uniq is not being saved.
- puts will print each element of an array on a new line (versus p, which will print the array on one line)
