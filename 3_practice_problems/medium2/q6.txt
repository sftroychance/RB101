How could the following method be simplified without changing its return value?

def color_valid(color)
  if color == "blue" || color == "green"
    true
  else
    false
  end
end

***

The expression by itself will return true or false, so we could make the expression the return value. Also, we could change the name of the method to reflect that a boolean is being returned.

def color_valid?(color)
  color == 'blue' || color == 'green'
end
