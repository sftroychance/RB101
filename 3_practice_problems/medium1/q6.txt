What is the output of the following code?

answer = 42

def mess_with_it(some_number)
  some_number += 8
end

new_answer = mess_with_it(answer)

p answer - 8

***

This will print:
34

answer is sent as an argument to mess_with_it, but it is not mutated by that method (it is an integer and is immutable anyway); the newly calculated value is returned from the method, but we don't do anything with it. The variable answer is not changed, so the result of calculation 42 - 8 will be printed.
