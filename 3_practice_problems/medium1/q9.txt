Consider these two simple methods:

def foo(param = "no")
  "yes"
end

def bar(param = "no")
  param == "no" ? "yes" : "no"
end

What would be the return value of the following method invocation?

bar(foo)

***

there is no local variable foo, so the foo method will be called and the result of that method will be sent as an argument to bar.

When foo is called, it will return "yes" (param is not an issue since it is not used in the method) =>

bar("yes")

the bar method is called with argument "yes", so within that method param is set to "yes"; the ternary statement in the method will evaluate to false, therefore the method will return "no".

result => "no"
