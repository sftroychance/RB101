Ben was tasked to write a simple ruby method to determine if an input string is an IP address representing dot-separated numbers. e.g. "10.4.5.11". He is not familiar with regular expressions. Alyssa supplied Ben with a method called is_an_ip_number? that determines if a string is a numeric string between 0 and 255 as required for IP numbers and asked Ben to use it.

def dot_separated_ip_address?(input_string)
  dot_separated_words = input_string.split(".")
  while dot_separated_words.size > 0 do
    word = dot_separated_words.pop
    break unless is_an_ip_number?(word)
  end
  return true
end

Alyssa reviewed Ben's code and says "It's a good start, but you missed a few things. You're not returning a false condition, and you're not handling the case that there are more or fewer than 4 components to the IP address (e.g. "4.5.5" or "1.2.3.4.5" should be invalid)."

Help Ben fix his code.

***

1. after splitting the string into an array, check the size of the array and return false if the size isn't 4
2. if any of the 'word' values is not valid, go ahead and return false at that point; break would break out of the while loop, not the method, so the method would always return true

def dot_separated_ip_address?(input_string)
  dot_separated_words = input_string.split(".")
  return false if dot_separated_words size != 4

  while dot_separated_words.size > 0 do
    word = dot_separated_words.pop
    return false unless is_an_ip_number?(word)
  end

  true
end
