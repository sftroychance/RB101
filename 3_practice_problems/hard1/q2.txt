What is the result of the last line in the code below?

greetings = { a: 'hi' }
informal_greeting = greetings[:a]
informal_greeting << ' there'

puts informal_greeting  #  => "hi there"
puts greetings

***

This will print:
{ a=>'hi there' }

informal greeting is assigned to the object greetings[:a]; after the assignment, they have the same object_id. Therefore, when informal_greeting is mutated by concatenation, greetings[:a] will also be affected.
