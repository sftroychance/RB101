# The British Empire adopted the Gregorian Calendar in 1752, which was a leap year. Prior to 1752, the Julian Calendar was used. Under the Julian Calendar, leap years occur in any year that is evenly divisible by 4.

# Using this information, update the method from the previous exercise to determine leap years both before and after 1752.
