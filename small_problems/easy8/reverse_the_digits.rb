# Write a method that takes a positive integer as an argument and returns that
# number with its digits reversed. Examples:
#
# Don't worry about arguments with leading zeros - Ruby sees those as octal
# numbers, which will cause confusing results. For similar reasons, the return
# value for our fourth example doesn't have any leading zeros.

def reversed_number(num)
  num.to_s.reverse.to_i
end

p reversed_number(12345) == 54321
p reversed_number(12213) == 31221
p reversed_number(456) == 654
p reversed_number(12000) == 21 # No leading zeros in return value!
p reversed_number(12003) == 30021
p reversed_number(1) == 1
