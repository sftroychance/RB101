Consider the following method and a call to that method:

  def my_method(a, b = 2, c = 3, d)
    p [a, b, c, d]
  end

  my_method(4, 5, 6)

Use the ruby documentation to determine what this code will print.

As a first guess, this will return an error for wrong number of arguments. There is not an argument sent for the d parameter. 

After checking documentation: ASSUMPTION INCORRECT! "Ruby allows default values to appear in the middle of positional arguments." In this case, the method call would assign a = 4, then d = 6, based on position, and then it will set b = 5 and keep c = 3. So it should print "[4, 5, 3, 6].

On testing code: [4, 5, 3, 6]
