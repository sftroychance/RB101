Sometimes, the documentation is going to leave you scratching your head.

In a very early assignment at Launch School, you are tasked with writing a program that loads some text messages from a YAML file. We do this with YAML::load_file:

  require 'yaml'
  MESSAGES = YAML.load_file('calculator_messages.yml')

Find the documentation for YAML::load_file.

The documentation for YAML can be located via the page for the Standard Library, where it is listed as a Default gem; the entry for YAML refers to the module Psych, and on that page the ::load_file method is documented.
