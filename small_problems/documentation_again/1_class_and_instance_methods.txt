Locate the ruby documentation for methods File::path and File#path. How are they different?

File::path is a class method, and File#path is an instance method, just going by those designations.  

The instance method File#path returns a string containing the pathname used to create that instance of the file object. 

The class method File::path returns a string containing the pathname of a file sent as an argument to the method. 

Note Pathname is a separate object that does not refer to the file itself.
