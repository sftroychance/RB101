What does this code print?

  5.step(to: 10, by: 3) { |value| puts value }

#step is a method in the Numeric class (Numeric is the parent of Intger). 

This loop will start at 5 and then increment by 3 until it reaches 10.

This is expected to print:
5
8

...and it does. 

Note that the documentation includes a reference to Array#take: my_array.take(4) would return an array with the first four elements of my_array.

Keyword arguments == named arguments; the argument names are symbols. Using named arguments, the arguments can be listed in any order.
