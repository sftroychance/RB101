Assume you have the following code:

  require 'date'

  puts Date.civil
  puts Date.civil(2016)
  puts Date.civil(2016, 5)
  puts Date.civil(2016, 5, 13)

What will each of the 4 puts statements print?

Per documentation:
civil([year=-4712[, month=1[, mday=1[, start=Date::ITALY]]]]) â†’ date

The puts statement calls the to_s method for the class. The Date#to_s method returns a string with the date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

The ::civil method is a class method, so as in the code, it can be called without a Date object being instantiated.  The documentation indicates that Date::civil is an alias for Date::new. 

puts Date.civil will print a string containing all the default values, since none are specified in the method call: "-4712-01-01"

puts Date.civil(2016) will print "2016-01-01"

puts Date.civil(2016, 5) will print "2016-05-01"

puts Date.civil(2016, 5, 13) will print "2016-05-13"
