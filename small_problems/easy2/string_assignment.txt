Take a look at the following code:

name = 'Bob'
save_name = name
name = 'Alice'
puts name, save_name

What does this code print out? Think about it for a moment before continuing.

If you said that code printed

Alice
Bob

you are 100% correct, and the answer should come as no surprise. Now, let's look at something a bit different:

name = 'Bob'
save_name = name
name.upcase!
puts name, save_name

What does this print out? Can you explain these results?

This will print:
BOB
BOB

name is assigned to the object 'Bob'.
save_name is assigned to the same object as name.
name is mutated, not reassigned, so it still points to the same address.
save_name is still pointing to that object, so its value is the same as the new valie for name.
